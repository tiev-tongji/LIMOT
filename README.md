# LIMOT
<!-- * The code will be released after the paper is accepted but we provide a [gtsam demo](https://github.com/Sonne-Zhu/gtsam_demo_limot) to illustrate and verify that gtsam is used correctly in LIMOT. -->
* A tightly-coupled multi-object tracking and LiDAR-inertial odometry system, allowing for joint estimation of the poses of both the ego-vehicle and surrounding objects.

## Dependency

We developed LIMOT on Ubuntu 20.04.
- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) (Noetic)
  ```
  sudo apt-get install -y ros-noetic-navigation
  sudo apt-get install -y ros-noetic-robot-localization
  sudo apt-get install -y ros-noetic-robot-state-publisher
  ```
- [gtsam](https://gtsam.org/get_started/) (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping library, recommended 4.0.3)
  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:borglab/gtsam-release-4.0
  sudo apt install libgtsam-dev libgtsam-unstable-dev
  ```
## Install

Use the following commands to download and compile the package.

```
mkdir -p ~/limot_ws/src
cd ~/limot_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/tiev-tongji/LIMOT.git
cd ..
catkin_make -j
```

## Run the package

1. Run the launch file:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch limot run_kitti.launch
```
2. Run your object detector, which subscribes to LiDAR scans and publishes the detection results with the formats: 

    [timestamp, [type, x, y, z, l, w, h, yaw, score], ...,[type ,x, ..., score]].

3. Play existing bag files:
```
rosbag play your-bag.bag
```
## Sample dataset

* Download the KITTI tracking dataset to test the functionality of the LIMOT. The dataset below are configured to run using the [params_kitti.yaml](./config/params_kitti.yaml):
