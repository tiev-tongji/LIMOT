# LIMOT
* The code will be released after the paper is accepted but we provide a [gtsam demo](https://github.com/Sonne-Zhu/gtsam_demo_limot) to illustrate and verify that gtsam is used correctly in LIMOT.
* Our previous work DL-SLOT has been accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles and published in the Early Access area on IEEE Xplore at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10255288.
